Problem statement: social scientists want to detect phenomena of interest on social media, but have difficulty processing terrabytes of Twitter data by hand. Solution: automate the classification of social media data by training machine learning models to detect phenomena of interest. As the problem requires classification, and the data conists of text/image content, we turn to deep learning for our method. Given the problem statement and a dataset, the method presents itself.

Notebooks for training deep learning models on text and image data. Primary method: convolutional neural networks. The code is associated with my dissertation, "Capturing Political Communication Online Using Image and Text Data: A Deep Learning Approach."
